## TODO

 * Route should be colored depending on safty (orange = bad, green = good)

 * Speech recognition


## LATER

    - path with the most monuments
    - path which goes through nature and parks
    - least turisty/popular path
 * Localize AirBNB and hostels depending on how much crime is in the area
